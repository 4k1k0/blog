Hello, I'm Rodrigo PatiÃ±o - net artist, software developer and mostly a human disaster.

I code, setup Linux servers and deploy software to the web.

I work mostly with Go and Node.js. I used to code in PHP ðŸ˜³ and I know a little bit of Rust, Elixir and C++ (along with other programming languages).
